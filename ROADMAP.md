## üî¥ CRITICAL Priority

### 1. Specification Pattern

**Status:** Not started
**Complexity:** Medium

For encapsulating business rules and queries with composable, reusable domain logic.

**Requirements:**

- Base `Specification[T]` class with `is_satisfied_by(entity: T) -> bool`
- Logical composition operators (AND, OR, NOT)
- Repository integration for query building
- SQLAlchemy query translation

**Benefits:**

- Prevents anemic domain models
- Enables complex, composable queries
- Centralizes business rules

---

### 2. Domain Service Pattern

**Status:** Not started
**Complexity:** Low

For operations that don't naturally fit in entities/aggregates.

**Requirements:**

- Base `DomainService` class with guidelines
- Clear distinction from application services
- Documentation and examples

**Benefits:**

- Provides structure for cross-aggregate operations
- Maintains domain logic in domain layer
- Prevents bloated aggregates

---

### 3. Aggregate Root Enforcement

**Status:** Partially implemented
**Complexity:** Medium

Ensure invariants across aggregate boundaries.

**Requirements:**

- Only aggregate roots retrievable via repositories
- Child entities accessible only through aggregate root
- Transaction boundaries aligned with aggregates
- Validation/enforcement mechanisms

**Current State:**

- Aggregate class exists with versioning
- No enforcement of aggregate boundaries

---

### 4. Event Publishing/Handling Infrastructure

**Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented (Sync + Async)
**Complexity:** High

**Requirements:**

- ‚úÖ Event bus/dispatcher implementation
- ‚úÖ Event handler registration and routing
- ‚úÖ Integration with UoW for transactional publishing
- ‚úÖ Async event handling support
- ‚úÖ Error handling (concurrent dispatch with error logging)
- ‚è≥ Retry strategies (future enhancement)

**Current State:**

- Events can be raised and collected via `Aggregate.raise_event()`
- Events can be flushed via `Aggregate.flush_events()`
- `HandlersRegistry` for synchronous event handlers
- `AsyncHandlersRegistry` for asynchronous event handlers
- Concurrent event dispatch with isolated error handling
- Integration with both sync and async UoW patterns
- Comprehensive test coverage (tests/events/test_async_event_bus.py)

**Implementation Details:**

- Synchronous handlers registered and dispatched via `HandlersRegistry`
- Asynchronous handlers run concurrently via `asyncio.gather()`
- Handler exceptions logged without stopping other handlers
- Type-safe handler registration using generics
